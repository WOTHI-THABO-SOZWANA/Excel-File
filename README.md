1. Introduction:
  This report analyzes a dataset of movies to assess their profitability. The analysis focuses on key metrics such as profit margin, profit/loss, and their distribution across different genres.

2. Data Analysis
   First changed the raw data and used the "Text to column" to turn the data to a more readable state.  Check for missing values in any columns, especially those crucial for analysis (e.g., Title, Release Date, Genre, Budget, Revenue). Ensure that data types are correct (e.g., dates as dates, numbers as numbers). Look for inconsistencies in data formats, units, or categories (e.g., different date formats, currency symbols). Checked for any outliers.
   Added two more columns named "Profit Made" and "ROI (Return on Investment)". Calculated PROFIT MADE by subtracting BUDGET from BOX OFFICD REVENUE, then calculated ROI by dividing PROFIT MADE by BUDGET. By calculating beither PROFIT MADE or ROI, I discovered that 93 Movies did not make any profit during from BOX OFFICE.
   Added another tab named "MOVIE SEARCH", there one can search for a movie title by either typing the key words or the whole movie title
   Added another tab named "PIVOT TABLE" where there is sum summary of all the movie budget and profits from each year( Quartely too)
   Added another tab named "GENRE" where I calculated how much money each genre made during the years 2012-2016 and then plotted the graphs of each genre from both genre 1 and 2. The most released genre between the years 2012-2016 was COMEDY.
   Added another tab named "DIRECTORS", where there is a list of all movie directors from the years 2012-2016, and how many movies they directored those years. There was one director that directed most movies in the years 2012-2016 whom was DAVID AYER. There were 445 directors in 2012-2016 in total.
   Added another tab named "ACTORS" where there a names of all the movie actors from the years 2012-2016 and how many movies they stared in. Upon searching that, it was discovered that there were two actors with the highest movies that they stared in, namely CHRIS HEMSWORTH and LIAM NEESON with a record of 9 movies. There was a total of 1371 actors in the years 2012-2016.
   Added another tab "MOVIES BY YEAR" where the list of movies are sorted out by their release year
